	-30°.
	-45°.
	-60°.

Homework #3:
Implement the Bresenham algorithm and draw a star using DDA and Bresenham algorithms.
Make a report with introduction, methodology, results and conclusions.

Homework #4:
Draw a circle using the equation y = sqrt(r*r - pow(x-xc, 2)) + yc.
Draw circle using simetry properties. That is: Calculate values from 0° to 45° and
use the simetry properties for draw all others point. Use polar coordinates. Out of origin.
Send all methods seen in class for drawing circles.
